  Hello, my name's Zhihao and I am a master’s student with TransData Lab under Professor Pu Wang at Central South University since 2017. Prior to join TransData Lab, I completed my bachelor’s degree in Transportation at Central South University, during which I visited The University of British Columbia and University of Oxford for short-term study.
