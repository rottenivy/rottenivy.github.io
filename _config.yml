  Hello I am Vincent! I am a PhD student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) with the Department of Civil Engineering. I work on the subject of spatiotemporal modeling for urban mobility under the supervision of Prof. Lijun Sun. Prior to joining McGill, I was a bachelor and master student at [Central South University](http://en.csu.edu.cn/). My master's research was about human mobility and complex network.

  If you are interested in my research, here are some papers that might interest you.

  - [Understanding Coupling Dynamics of Public Transportation Networks](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0148-6): The literature review in the paper is a good resource for you if you want to learn about multiplex network theory and transportation. If you are also interested in using smart card data for trip reconstruction, the methods presented in this paper might give you some help. You don't have to read the results part, as they are lengthy and highly empirical.
