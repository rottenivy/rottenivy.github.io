  Hello I am Vincent! I am a PhD student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) with the Department of Civil Engineering, starting from Jan, 2021. I work with [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/) on the subject of spatiotemporal modeling for urban mobility. I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Transportation Engineering from [Central South University](http://en.csu.edu.cn/) in 2017 and 2020. My master's research was about human mobility and complex network. Please feel free to reach out if you have any question!

  Here list some reading guides to some of my papers that might make your time worthy. I won't call them selected publications as they are not necessarily from flag journals. Nevertheless, you can always check my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h2Et54sAAAAJ&hl=en) to take a look at my most recent papers and a complete list of my publications.

  - [Understanding Coupling Dynamics of Public Transportation Networks](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0148-6): The literature review is a good start if you are interested in multiplex network theory and transportation. If you are also interested in using smart card data for trip reconstruction, the methods part might give you some help. You don't have to read the results part, as they are lengthy and highly empirical.
