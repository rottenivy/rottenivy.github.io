  Hello, my name's Zhihao and I am a master’s student with TransData Lab under Professor Pu Wang at Central South University since 2017. Prior to join TransData Lab, I completed my bachelor’s degree in Transportation at Central South University, during which I visited The University of British Columbia and University of Oxford for short-term study. I won the 1st prize winner of the 2016 National Competition of Transport Science and Technology of China. I was ranked top 3 in my major and and I graduated from CSU with the highest honor in 2017.
